Functions for the DHT11 Module
The DHT11 module will provide:

    - Constructor to initialize the sensor (with the GPIO pin number).
    - read() to get the temperature and humidity values from the sensor.
    - Error handling for timeout or checksum issues.
    - A helper function to parse the data from the sensor.

Library Structure

    - DHT11.h: Header file for the DHT11 class.
    - DHT11.cpp: Implementation of the DHT11 class.
    - main.cpp: Main program that uses the DHT11 library.




Explanation
1- Start Signal:
    The program sends a low signal for at least 18ms, followed by a high signal for 20–40µs.

2- Sensor Response:
    The DHT11 pulls the line low for 80µs and then high for another 80µs to indicate readiness.

3- Data Transmission:
    The sensor sends 40 bits (5 bytes). Each bit starts with a LOW signal followed by a HIGH signal:
        - A 0-bit HIGH signal is ~26–28µs.
        - A 1-bit HIGH signal is ~70µs.

Checksum:
    The last byte is the checksum. It must match the sum of the first four bytes.

Reading Values:
    - Humidity is represented by the first two bytes.
    - Temperature is represented by the next two bytes.



Compile the program: g++ -o gpio_program main.cpp GPIO.cpp -lpigpio -lrt

Run the program with root privileges (needed for pigpio): sudo ./gpio_program

===========================
build : g++ -o dht11_program Examples/sensors/DHT11/main.cpp Examples/sensors/DHT11/DHT11.cpp Examples/blink/GPIO.cpp -IExamples/blink -lpigpio -lrt

Examples/sensors/DHT11/main.cpp: Main program.
Examples/sensors/DHT11/DHT11.cpp: DHT11 implementation file.
Examples/blink/GPIO.cpp: GPIO implementation file.
-IExamples/blink: Adds Examples/blink as an include directory so the compiler can locate GPIO.h.
-lpigpio -lrt: Links the necessary libraries.

===========================


Hardware Setup
Connect the DHT11 to the Raspberry Pi:

VCC → 5V
GND → GND
Data → GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 4)
Use a 10kΩ pull-up resistor between VCC and Data.
